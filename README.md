# WEATHER-ADAPTIVE-TIMETABLE-GENERATOR-FOR-RENEWABLE-ENERGY-UTILIZATION

A Flask-based web application that intelligently reschedules energy-intensive lab sessions based on real-time weather forecasts. By integrating OpenWeatherMap API, the system optimizes lab timings for sunny days, maximizing solar energy use and reducing electricity consumption from non-renewable sources.

📌 Key Features:

📥 Upload class timetables in CSV format

🌤 Real-time weather data integration (OpenWeatherMap API)

🔁 Auto-rescheduling of labs to sunniest time slots

📄 Downloadable, solar-optimized timetables

⚡ 20–30% energy savings in pilot tests

📊 User-friendly interface (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja2)

🐍 Built with Python, Flask, Pandas, Requests

📁 File management & history tracking

🔒 Cloud-ready & Docker-compatible

🚀 Future Enhancements:

Predictive scheduling using machine learning

IoT-based solar monitoring

Manual override controls for real-time flexibility
